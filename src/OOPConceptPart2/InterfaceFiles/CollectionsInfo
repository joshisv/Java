Collections

	A collection is an object that can hold references to other objects. 
	The collection interfaces declare the operations that can be performed on each type of collection.
	
	The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store 
	and manipulate the group of objects.

	Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data 
	such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

	Java Collection means a single unit of objects. 
	Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) 
		and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
